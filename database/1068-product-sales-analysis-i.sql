Table: Product

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the product name of each product.

Write an SQL query that reports the product_name, year, and price for each sale_id in the Sales table.
Return the resulting table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Sales table:
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+ 
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
Product table:
+------------+--------------+
| product_id | product_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 100        | Nokia        |
| 200        | Apple        |
| 300        | Samsung      |
+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+--------------+-------+-------+
| product_name | year  | price |
+--------------+-------+-------+
| Nokia        | 2008  | 5000  |
| Nokia        | 2009  | 5000  |
| Apple        | 2011  | 9000  |
+--------------+-------+-------+
Explanation: 
From sale_id = 1, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2008.
From sale_id = 2, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2009.
From sale_id = 7, we can conclude that Apple was sold for 9000 in the year 2011.
