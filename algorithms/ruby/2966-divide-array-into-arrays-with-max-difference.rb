# https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-arrays-with-max-difference

=begin
You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.
Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:
* Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.
* The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.
Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]
Explanation: We can divide the array into the following arrays: [1,1,3], [3,4,5] and [7,8,9].
The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.
Note that the order of elements is not important.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,3,2,7,3], k = 3
Output: []
Explanation: It is not possible to divide the array satisfying all the conditions.

Constraints:
* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 105
* n is a multiple of 3.
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 105
* 1 <= k <= 105
